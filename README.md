## What is Witsy?

This package automates the installation of the Witsy application. Witsy is a BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys) AI application: it means you need to have API keys for the LLM providers you want to use. Alternatively, you can use [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) to run models locally on your machine for free and use them in Witsy.

- Chat completion with vision models support (describe an image)
- Text-to-image and text-to video with OpenAI, HuggingFace and Replicate
- Scratchpad to interactively create the best content with any model!
- Prompt anywhere allows to generate content directly in any application
- AI commands runnable on highlighted text in almost any application
- Experts prompts to specialize your bot on a specific topic
- LLM plugins to augment LLM: execute python code, search the Internet...
- Long-term memory plugin to increase relevance of LLM answers
- Read aloud of assistant messages (requires OpenAI or ElevenLabs API key)
- Read aloud of any text in other applications (requires OpenAI or ElevenLabs API key)
- Chat with your local files and documents (RAG)
- Transcription/Dictation (Speech-to-Text)
